FeatureMapper
=============

FeatureMapper coordinates the presentation of input patterns, collating and analyzing the responses to measure 
feature maps, tuning curves, receptive fields, PSTHs, etc. FeatureMapper is fully functional, and is used
heavily in the Topographica project (see topographica.org), but we have not yet put together detailed
documentation and tutorials.

Installation
============

FeatureMapper requires `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_, `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, `ImaGen <http://ioam.github.com/imagen/>`_,  and `Param <http://ioam.github.com/param/>`_.
